# refactoring_practice

This file shows good and bad practices of coding. There are good examples of refactoring the analysis.

Optimizing code file shows difference in time required among for loop, np.intersection1d and set's intersection method. The set's intersection method is the fastest and takes about a fraction of second to run the comparison whereas for loop tool ~17 seconds.
